![Facial Emotion Recognition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/yourimage.jpg)  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project aims to classify human facial expressions into different emotions using **Deep Learning**. A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained to recognize emotions from facial images and can be deployed for **real-time facial emotion detection** using a webcam.  

🔹 **Emotions Detected:**  
✅ Happy 😊  
✅ Sad 😔  
✅ Angry 😡  
✅ Neutral 😐  
✅ Surprised 😲  
✅ Fearful 😨  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
✔️ **Deep Learning-based Emotion Recognition** using **CNN & Transfer Learning** (VGG16, InceptionResNetV2)  
✔️ **Real-time Emotion Detection App** using **OpenCV** & **Flask**  
✔️ **Preprocessing & Augmentation** for improved model accuracy  
✔️ **Performance Evaluation** using Accuracy, Precision, Recall & Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Model Training & Performance  

### 🔍 **Dataset & Preprocessing**  
- The dataset consists of labeled facial images with different emotions.  
- **Preprocessing Steps:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  

### 🧠 **Deep Learning Model**  
- Built using **CNN + Transfer Learning (VGG16, InceptionResNetV2)**  
- Optimized using **Adam Optimizer, Categorical Crossentropy Loss**  

### 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Accuracy:** ~85%  
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** Some emotions like "Happy" & "Neutral" were classified well, while "Fear" & "Surprise" had some misclassifications.
